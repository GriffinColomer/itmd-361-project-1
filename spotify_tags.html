      <h2>What Spotify Tags are Most Common for Me</h2>
      <p>My favorite music streaming service is Spotify. It has so many benefits that I could go over, but something I really enjoy is the Daylist. Spotify creates a custom play list that gets refreshed 4 times per day. Personally enjoying some variance in the music I listen to I often would listen to these playlists.</p>
      <p>After a while I haad realised it shows what tags are actually used to generate the playlist. I thought about it and decided. I should catalogue all of the tags I get. This led me down year long project where everytime I listened to the daylist I took a picture of the daylist.</p>
      <p>Recently I noticed that I had a little over 500 pictures of the daylist, and I should put the tags into a dataset so I could analyze what I listend to. This was quite the task, I didn't want to manually read and count the tags of each picture so I decided to create a script to do it for me.</p>

      <h2>Project Method</h2>
      <p>To extract the text and put it into a dataset: I took every image ran it under preprocessing, fed it to pytesseract to extract text, parsed out the tags, and created a json file with the title of the dyalist and the tags (if multiple days had the same name the tags had an incrementing number to represent multiple). </p>
      <h3>Initial Image</h3>
      <p>Here are a few examples of what the screenshot I took look like. You can see some of the tags are underlined and highlited green while some are not. I'm not sure what determines this but it is noticible.</p>

      </section>
      <h3>Image PreProcessing</h3>
      <p>To makesure pytesseract is able to read the images, I ran them against a threshold, scaled them and inverted them to be black text white background.</p>

      </section>
      <h3>Parsing</h3>
      <p>when the image was ran through pytesseract it output all the text on the page which was more than i needed. Just wanting the tags at the bottom I created an algorithm to run the text through to extract tht tages and title into a json to eventually end up with this.</p>

      <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
      <p>After completing this project I had lots of fun loking at the different graphs and trends that I could see. It was fun to see what I listened to most commonly some of the weirder genres that popped up. My favorite data model I created from this was actually a word cloud that is below. Finally I don't recomend using the same method I did to get all this data. It took forever and I definitely forgot to take some pictures some days.</p>
      <p>Also here is a song I found on spotify recently that I enjoy listening too, for the media requirements for this project. <audio controls>
